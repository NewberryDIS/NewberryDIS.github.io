Gehl</h3>\n<p>Welcome to <em>Humanism For Sale</em>, which concerns the ways books were written, designed, printed, and marketed for schools in Renaissance Italy.</p>\n<p>This started out to be a scholarly book, but I have decided to publish it as a blog instead. This dynamic form will allow me to present source documents in facsimile, and to revise, correct, and discuss my research with many potential readers. I am thinking of at least three groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfs/spc\">Scholarly specialists</a> in printing history and history of education</li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"generalists.html\">Generalist readers</a> and <a href=\"generalists.html\">scholars in other fields</a> who want to know more about the Renaissance and the way people were educated then</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"design_contents.html\">Designers</a>, <a href=\"marketing.html\">marketing professionals</a>, <a href=\"educators.html\">educators</a> and others interested in the history of visual communication</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Or you may wish to go directly to the <a href=\"quick_summary.html\">quick summary</a>, the <a href=\"abstract.html\">abstract</a>, or <a href=\"/web/20130605190527/http://humanismforsale.org/text/\">table of contents</a>.</p>\n<p>My reasons for publishing in this form are outlined in a <a href=\"personal_statement.html\">Personal Statement</a>.  My background is summarized in a resume or <a href=\"/cv\">Curriculum Vitae</a>.  Lots of people have helped me with this book and this blog; they are thanked in the <a href=\"acknowledgements.html\">Acknowledgements</a>.</p>\n<p>Feedback is welcome in the usual blog format. I invite comments from anyone, but I will necessarily work on the blog only as time permits.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/","title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"875cf2bb-f15a-56ca-b7d1-88cb3980a2f7"}},
