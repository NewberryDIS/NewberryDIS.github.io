(57) Soardi, like the Giunta, presented the Ricardini text in octavo. We might have treated this edition under the rubric of octavo formats, but Soardi's quirky typography and formatting were less influential than the contemporary Aldines, and the real significance of this edition lies in its use of the critical text as a marketing tool. Soardi surrounded his octavo (and in other cases, 12mo) pages with prettifying floral borders. He employed a fussy italic of his own design for the text and filled out the spaces at the end of short poetic lines with curlicues. Any space left at the end of a volume he filled up with jocose addresses to the reader, and he often provided front matter in the same vein.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_796\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"288\" caption=\"Prettifying  borders (click to enlarge - 659 KB jpeg file)\"]<a rel=\"pop-up\" href=\"http://www.humanismforsale.org/text/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-ZP-535.S-6755-HVC-Pugillari,-pg.10v-11r.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-796\" title=\"wing-zp-535s-6755-hvc-pugillari-pg10v-11r-thumb\" src=\"http://www.humanismforsale.org/text/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wing-zp-535s-6755-hvc-pugillari-pg10v-11r-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Prettifying  borders (click to enlarge - 659 KB jpeg file)\" width=\"288\" height=\"229\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>Soardi's 1511 Terence is crowded and busy in the extreme. To the modern eye this odd design might seem to undermine the textual claims of its serious humanist editors. It is hard to say, however, that early sixteenth century readers would have judged it in the same way. Since Soardi was producing fully illustrated and annotated folio Terences for teachers throughout this same period, it seems likely that he saw these little octavos as strictly student copies.

Despite its floral border the title page is highly typographic.

It was unusual at the period to segregate apparatus from school text with so sharp a design change. We cannot know for certain what Soardi had in mind, but the strategy had to be deliberate.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_800\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"288\" caption=\"A not-so-serious ending (click to enlarge - 633 KB jpeg file)\"]<a rel=\"pop-up\" href=\"http://www.humanismforsale.org/text/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-ZP-535.S-6755-HVC-Pugillari,-pg.135v-136r.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-800\" title=\"wing-zp-535s-6755-hvc-pugillari-pg135v-136r-thumb\" src=\"http://www.humanismforsale.org/text/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wing-zp-535s-6755-hvc-pugillari-pg135v-136r-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"A not-so-serious ending (click to enlarge - 633 KB jpeg file)\" width=\"288\" height=\"221\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>The last three pages of Soardi's octavo Terence contained the usual publication information but were also filled out with short prayers, proverbs, and poor verses about the processes of printing and book selling. These added materials could as well apply to other texts than Terence and some bits in fact appeared on other books from Soardi's press. They confirm our sense that this little Terence, for all its claims to textual originality, was offered for a student market. The colophon said the book was edited by \"a certain learned man\" (apparently the front matter sufficed to name him) and carefully printed by Lazzaro Soardi in August of 1511. This was followed by an \"Apology of Lazzaro\" (<em>Excusatio Lazari</em>) in which he said the reader should freely correct any errors that he finds. These six lines of verse conveniently contained a misprint that resulted in an error of noun-adjective agreement; it was corrected by hand in some copies.
